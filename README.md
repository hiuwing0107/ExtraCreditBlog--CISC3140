# Summary

## Blog Objective

Through the blog, I hope I can express myself and share my learning experiences in those diaries. During this semester, I can use it to make a record of my learning schedule. Not only the things I learned in class, but also the other computer skills that I wanted to understand. After a long time, I can look back my blog, then I can relive all the knowledges. Since for some specific computer topics, such as some project. I put all the steps and procedures of my works. Therefore, if I forget anything, I can review it and do the practice again.

Also, in the blog, I used words, images, and sounds to grab my memories. It was a really helpful assignment since it gave me an opportunity to create a blog. This is my first blog. For the entire blog, I designed everything by myself. For example, the background color, the blog description, the font family, and etc. During the process, It brings me the sense of achievement.
